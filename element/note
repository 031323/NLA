-Existence of solution of poisson's equation.
	By the existence of solution of 2 and equivalence of 1 and 2.

-If u solves 2 then u solves 1? In weak sense?
	Proposition 5.1.9 Page 131 Brenner & Scott.
	For u=g on boundary find g_ s.t. g_=g on boundary and find solution of u-g
	For du/dv = h on boundary, extra term.

-If u is doubly differentiable then?
	Clearly if u solves 1 then it solves 2.
	Converse: Proposition 5.1.9 Page 131 Brenner & Scott., and that the weak derivate is equal to strong derivative for differentiable functions.
	
-Do without Lax-Miligram lemma. (Au=F)
	A should be onto. Injectivity implies uniqueness.

//TODO:
-When does Lagrange element not work?
	Brenner & Scott chapter 10.

//TODO:
-Order of convergence.

//TODO:
-In P1 nonconforming, why is continuity required at midpoints?
